For a 10MB file:
regular copy: 0.202s
copy with a 10 times larger buffer: 0.096s
copy synced: 28.584s
copy with a 10 times larger buffer, synced: 3.128s

For a 1MB file:
regular copy: 0.012s
copy with a 10 times larger buffer: 0.012s
copy synced: 0.115s
copy with a 10 times larger buffer, synced: 0.115s

Results:
- increasing size of file execution time increases
- increasing the size of the buffer decreases execution time because it makes less I/O calls
- syncing the copying causes a significant increase of execution time due to the overhead of synchronised
